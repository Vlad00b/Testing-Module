                text: `<p>Unidentified Farming Object<br>
                One night last summer, while my husband, Earl, watched television in the family room.
                I relaxed and read in our bedroom. It was another nice, peaceful night in our quiet rural
                neighbourhood. It was about 10 p.m., when Earl burst into the bedroom shouting, "Get up!
                There’s something in the pasture – it looks like a UFO, It’s all covered in lights and is heading
                straight for the house!"

                I felt my heart pounding against my chest as I jumped up, grabbed my housecoat and shoes,
                and ran outside with Earl to face whatever crisis was happening out there in the dark. And
                there it was, speeding directly toward us: an enormous object with light radiating all around
                it. The light was so blinding we couldn’t actually see the thing itself. For a second, I wondered
                if it really was a UFO. What else could it be?
                Whatever it was, it was scary, coming out of nowhere, heading toward us at a high speed,
                lights blazing in the country darkness. But right before it reached the pasture fence, it made a
                fast turn. Without the lights shining directly in our eyes, we could see that it was a big highpowered tractor mower, lit up like Times Square on wheels.
                That’s when we remembered that, several weeks earlier, we’d asked a neighbour if he knew
                anyone who could mow our pasture. He said he knew a fellow who planned to mow his hay
                nearby and might do ours at the same time, but he didn’t know when. After some time, we
                learnt that the tractor driver was in the hospital with back trouble. But as the weeks went by,
                we forgot the whole matter.
                Apparently, the fellow had either recovered or had hired someone to mow his hay. Whoever it
                was, he or she decided to finish off the day by driving in through our open gate and doing our
                pasture after dark.
                We were extremely relieved to see that our unexpected meeting had nothing to do with aliens
                determined to start their Earth invasion in our pasture. By the time our heart rates had settled
                down to normal, we burst into laughter.</p>`,

Ding, ding! When you visit the website Spatulatta: Cooking 4 Kids Online, a cheery bell
signals that the fun is about to begin. Isabella and Olivia Gerasole of Chicago, Illinois, use
the power of video to teach kids how to prepare tasty recipes. The cool thing is, the sisters
are kids themselves. When last year they won for their website a James Beard Foundation
award, named after a world-famous chef, these grade-schoolers became the youngest cooks
ever to receive recognition from the group.
The idea for the website came from their neighbour, film producer Gaylon Emerzian.
Isabella, 11, says when Emerzian asked the sisters if they’d like to help with a cooking
website for kids, they knew right away that it would be fun. “We could do a website
ourselves at home and reach kids all around the world”, Isabella says. “We get recipes and
fan mail from lots of different countries.”
The sisters film new segments every two weeks. They set aside four or five hours to work, often while the neighbourhood 
kids are outside playing, and have learned a lot about lighting, filming, and editing. 
“The sacrifice is worth it”, says Isabella. 
“Sometimes it is hard to fit in, but when you see your finished work on the website, it is the greatest feeling!”

Olivia, 9, has this advice: “If you mess up, it is just fine. I mess up all the time!” She says she’s short and often can’t reach bowls to stir properly. She’s learned to use a stool and keep trying, “Mess-ups can be frustrating, but you’ll get it some time!”
Since winning the award, the girls have been interviewed by television, radio, and newspaper
reporters. They’ve learned that hard work can not only turn out to be fun, but can lead to
surprising results. Isabella and Olivia have also learned that one good idea can lead to
another. Their new cookbook will roll off the presses this fall.</p>`,
